#ldapjs-sql

This is a small utility for bridging a MySQL database full of users to LDAP.

You can run this program like `node ldapjs-sql.js --config /path/to/config`

Your config file needs to be a javascript file that exports a module. See `config.exampe.js` for an example file with comments on what everything does.
